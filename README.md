# Ethical-Hacking-Lab-Environment
Welcome to my first project, i have created this virtual lab environment as part of my college studies.
In this lab i want focus on red team and blue team techniques can be used part of real cyber-attacks or while conducting penetration test.
The lab installed and tested on Virtual-Box.

## Lab Contains

1. Windows Server 2019
2. ELK
3. Windows 10
4. Windows 10
5. Ubuntu 18
6. PFSense

### Main Topics
* Network Scanning & Detection
* Brute-Forcing & Detection
* SQL Injection & Detection
* OS Command Injection & Detection
* Linux Enumeration & Detection
* Privilege Esclation & Detection
* MITM IPv6 Takedown & Detection
* Active Directory Attacks And Defesne
* Phishing Scenario And Defense techniques
* Malware-Analysis

#### How Its Works
This lab created for education purpose only.
The best way for learning about this lab will be download all the machines and run them with Virtual-Box, bring your own attacker machine its can be kali or whatever attacker machine you want to use, connect your attacker machine to bridge and you good to go.
The main goal its try hack as many machines as you can, this lab created by design vulnerable.
This lab very similar to CTF challenges so the best way its try to find your way to own the network.

##### Files

* RedTeamVSBlueTeam - This is my main report and writeup about the lab, here i show what i learned from my last year attacks and defense techniques and also show my way how the attacker start from boot until we got access to all the network.

* Malware-Analysis - My second report this time make phishing scenario showing all the process how its works and then move to malware-analysis about the scenario.

* creds.txt - this file will include all the credentails for all the machines on the network.
Before you look on creds the best way its try find the way to get all the credentials without looking on this file this is the main challenge, if you stuck you always can check the file again. :)
